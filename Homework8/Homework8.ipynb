The spectrograms are actually created using Short-time Fourier Transform(STFT). It helps us to do a time-varying analysis of the signal provided. Anyway, it is not required to get into the depth of this topic. The main concept is that we divide the audio signal into small pieces and then that audio signal is plotted on the graph against time.
