You should replace the `...` markers with your code. Do not change the names of the pre-defined ALL_CAPS variables and functions.

Don't connect the dots in the plot! You should set up a function that does the plotting for you. It's up to you on how much to put in the function, and how much to do outside. Add axis labels and a title that includes \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", or \"d\", depending on the sample. This answer does not need to match a special pattern, I'll be grading it by eye. Personally, I made a 2x2 suplots grid then ran my function on each axes. Since the default spacing was awful, I called `plt.tight_layout()` after making the plots."
