You should replace the `...` markers with your code. Do not change the names of the pre-defined ALL_CAPS variables and functions. (If you start from scratch, make sure you match the requested function names and requested ALL_CAPS variables). Other that that, you are free to define or make anything you wish. Remember that functions will often be tested with different numbers than the ones you are given.\n",
